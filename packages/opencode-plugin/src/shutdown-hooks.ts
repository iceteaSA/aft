/**
 * Process-level shutdown handlers.
 *
 * OpenCode does not reliably await plugin `dispose()` before Node exits, and
 * host-level SIGTERM/SIGINT propagate to our `aft` children through the process
 * group. Without explicit cleanup, children see SIGTERM, their `exit` handler
 * fires, and (before the sibling fix in bridge.ts) they would auto-restart into
 * orphaned processes. Even with that fixed, we still want orderly shutdown so
 * pending requests get rejected and the bridges terminate before Node is gone.
 *
 * Each plugin instance (and there can be several per Node process when OpenCode
 * loads the plugin from multiple contexts) registers its cleanup callback here.
 * We install the OS-level signal handlers exactly once per Node process via a
 * `globalThis` guard — otherwise each plugin reload would stack another SIGTERM
 * listener and fire duplicate shutdowns.
