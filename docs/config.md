# Configuration

AFT uses a two-level config system: user-level defaults plus project-level overrides.
Both files are JSONC (comments allowed). One location serves every harness:

| Scope | Path |
|---|---|
| User | `~/.config/cortexkit/aft.jsonc` |
| Project | `<project>/.cortexkit/aft.jsonc` |

Older installs used per-harness paths (`~/.config/opencode/aft.jsonc`, `~/.pi/agent/aft.jsonc`,
and their project-level equivalents). On first load, the plugin migrates them to the CortexKit
location automatically and leaves a `.MOVED_READPLEASE` marker behind.

## Config Options

```jsonc
{
  // Master switch. Default: true. Set false in user config to disable AFT
  // everywhere, or in project config to disable only that project. Project
  // config can set true to re-enable over a user-level false.
  "enabled": true,

  // Replace the host harness's built-in tools (read/write/edit/apply_patch/grep/etc.)
  // with AFT-enhanced versions. Default: true. Set to false to use aft_ prefix on all
  // tools instead — useful when you want to keep the harness defaults and access AFT
  // tools alongside them under explicit names.
  "hoist_builtin_tools": true,

  // Auto-format files after edits. Default: false. When enabled, formatting is
  // queued and runs after ~90s without further edits to the file.
  "format_on_edit": false,

  // Auto-validate after edits: "syntax" (tree-sitter, fast) or "full" (runs type checker)
  "validate_on_edit": "syntax",

  // Per-language formatter overrides (auto-detected from project config files if omitted)
  // Keys: "typescript", "python", "rust", "go"
  // Values: "biome" | "oxfmt" | "prettier" | "deno" | "ruff" | "black" | "rustfmt" | "goimports" | "gofmt" | "none"
  "formatter": {
    "typescript": "biome",

  "checker": {
    "typescript": "biome"
  },

  // How missing formatter/checker/LSP warnings appear after configure.
  // Default: "toast" — 10s TUI/HTTP toast, no session chat pollution.
  // "log" — plugin log only. "chat" — legacy ignored messages in the transcript.
  // Formatter warnings run only when format_on_edit is true or formatter.<lang> is set.
  // Checker warnings run only when validate_on_edit is "syntax"/"full" or checker.<lang> is set.
  // (There is no top-level "formatters" key — use format_on_edit / formatter / checker.)
  "configure_warnings_delivery": "toast",

  // Tool surface level: "minimal" | "recommended" (default) | "all"
  // minimal:     aft_outline, aft_zoom, aft_safety only (no hoisting)
  // recommended: minimal + hoisted tools (read/write/edit/apply_patch/bash)
  //              + lsp_diagnostics + ast_grep + aft_import + aft_conflicts
  //              + aft_inspect + grep/glob (when search_index is enabled)
  //              + aft_search (when semantic_search is enabled)
  //              (bash sub-features are gated by the top-level `bash` block)

  // Semantic code search (graduated from experimental in v0.18; aft_search tool).
  // Default backend is fastembed (local ONNX, no network) and requires ONNX Runtime

AFT auto-detects the formatter and checker from project config files (`biome.json` → biome,
`.oxfmtrc.json` / `.oxfmtrc.jsonc` / `oxfmt.config.ts` → oxfmt, `.prettierrc` → prettier,
`Cargo.toml` → rustfmt, `pyproject.toml` → ruff/black, `go.mod` → goimports). Local tool binaries
(biome, oxfmt, prettier, tsc, pyright) are discovered in
`node_modules/.bin` before falling back to the system PATH. You only need per-language overrides
if auto-detection picks the wrong tool or you want to pin a specific formatter.

## Native command sandbox

Set `sandbox.enabled` to route first-party bash and PTY commands through Seatbelt on macOS or Landlock on Linux. Unsupported platforms, unavailable kernels, Landlock ABIs below V3, invalid profiles, and policies that cannot preserve the credential floor fail closed with a structured `sandbox_unavailable` response. Sandboxed commands receive a private task temporary directory through `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP`; Linux does not grant the shared `/tmp` tree.

The mandatory credential floor is `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.azure`, `~/.config/gcloud`, and `~/.config/cortexkit`. Linux canonicalizes these paths and constructs a read allowlist that omits them. A writable project, cache, temporary directory, or `write_allow` path that overlaps this floor is refused because Landlock cannot subtract write rights. Ordinary `read_deny` paths inside writable roots are supported: writes remain allowed while read grants are split around the denied path.

| Protection | macOS Seatbelt | Linux Landlock |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credential floor reads and writes | Denied | Denied by omission; overlapping writable roots are refused |
| Project, task artifact, cache, and private task-temp access | Read/write | Read/write |
| Other existing HOME children | Readable; HOME remains unwritable | Readable only when present at launch; new children are denied until the next launch |
| System files | Readable; unwritable | Curated read-only roots; `/proc` is readable, `/sys` is limited, `/run/user`, `/var/run`, `/dev/shm`, `/dev/kmsg`, and shared `/tmp` are omitted |
| Git metadata | Writable so `git add` and `git commit` work | Writable inside project roots |
| Resolved Git hooks, including linked-worktree and `core.hooksPath` locations | Read/write denied after the project allow rule | Read denied; writes inside a writable project remain allowed |
| Nested `.cortexkit` writes | Denied | Not enforceable inside a writable project |
| Unix-domain socket connections such as Docker and SSH agent sockets | Denied by path | Not mediated; connections remain allowed |
| TCP, UDP, DNS, and raw sockets | Open | Open |
| Unsupported native platform | `sandbox_unavailable` | `sandbox_unavailable` |

### Linux guarantee boundary

The Linux guarantee applies to canonical paths without pre-existing aliases into a granted tree. Granted project, cache, task, and system trees are treated as trusted content. The following limitations are deliberate and surfaced honestly:

- Landlock rules are additive, so nested write-denies under a writable project cannot protect `.git/hooks` or `.cortexkit`. The launcher handles and grants `REFER` only with writable-root rules, which keeps normal in-project renames working and rejects creation of a hard link that would widen access to a denied secret. A pre-existing hard link inside a granted tree remains readable or writable through that alias.
- Landlock does not mediate `AF_UNIX` connects. Docker sockets, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, and other pathname Unix sockets can still be reached when normal filesystem permissions allow it.
- Pre-existing bind mounts, case-insensitive filesystem aliases, and overlayfs aliases can expose an object through a granted path. These alias classes are outside the canonical-path guarantee.
- `/proc` is granted wholesale for process and toolchain compatibility. With Yama `ptrace_scope=0`, another same-UID process may expose `/proc/<pid>/environ`, `maps`, or `mem`. Missing, unreadable, or unparseable Yama configuration is treated conservatively as exposed and produces a warning. Yama does not cover every `/proc` surface.

Compared with Codex's default sandbox, AFT is stricter about credential reads: Codex workspace-write can read the host filesystem, including HOME secrets. Codex is stricter about network access and repository metadata: its default disables network access and keeps `.git` read-only, while AFT deliberately leaves the network open and permits Git metadata writes. Neither posture should be described as uniformly stricter.

## Config schema migration

v0.18 reorganized experimental flags. Old config files using the flat shape:

```jsonc
{
  "experimental_search_index": true,
  "experimental_semantic_search": true,
  "experimental_lsp_ty": true,
  "experimental_bash_rewrite": true,
  "experimental_bash_compress": true,
  "experimental_bash_background": true
}
```

are migrated automatically on first load to the v0.18 shape:

```jsonc
{
  "search_index": true,        // graduated
  "semantic_search": true,     // graduated
  "experimental": {
    "lsp_ty": true,
    "bash": { "rewrite": true, "compress": true, "background": true }
  }
}
```

The original file is rewritten in place (both `.jsonc` and `.json` candidates are migrated).
JSONC comments are preserved. Both user-level and project-level configs are migrated
independently. The migration is idempotent — running again is a no-op.

**v0.27.2** further graduated the bash flags out of `experimental`. A config still using
`experimental.bash.{rewrite,compress,background}` is read transparently as a fallback, but the
canonical shape is the top-level `bash` block shown above. `experimental` now holds only
`lsp_ty`.

## Language servers (LSP)

AFT runs language servers in-process for post-edit diagnostics and on-demand `lsp_diagnostics`
calls. Servers are spawned lazily — only when a file matching their extensions is touched, and
only if their binary is on `PATH`.

**Built-in servers** (auto-registered, no config needed):

| Server | Languages | Binary |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript Language Server | `.ts .tsx .js .jsx .mjs .cjs` | `typescript-language-server` |
| Pyright | `.py .pyi` | `pyright-langserver` |
| rust-analyzer | `.rs` | `rust-analyzer` |
| gopls | `.go` | `gopls` |
| bash-language-server | `.sh .bash .zsh` | `bash-language-server` |
| yaml-language-server | `.yaml .yml` | `yaml-language-server` |

**Experimental:** `ty` (Astral's Python type checker) — gated behind
`experimental.lsp_ty: true` or `lsp.python: "ty"`. When enabled, ty runs alongside Pyright
unless you also disable Pyright via `lsp.disabled: ["python"]` (or use `lsp.python: "ty"`
which does both automatically).

**Registering a custom server:** add it under `lsp.servers` in your config. The example
configuration above shows registering `tinymist` for Typst files. Required fields per server:
`extensions` (array, leading `.` is stripped), `binary` (PATH lookup name). Optional:
`args`, `root_markers` (defaults to `[".git"]`), `disabled`.

**Disabling a built-in:** add the server's id to `lsp.disabled`. Built-in ids are
`typescript`, `python` (Pyright), `rust` (rust-analyzer), `go` (gopls), `bash`,
`yaml`, and `ty`. Custom servers use the key you registered them under in
`lsp.servers`. IDs are case-insensitive.

**Custom server fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `extensions` | yes | Array of file extensions (leading `.` is stripped) |
| `binary` | yes | Binary name resolved against `PATH` |
| `args` | no | Args passed to the server (default: `[]`) |
| `root_markers` | no | Filenames whose presence anchors the workspace root (default: `[".git"]`) |
| `env` | no | Extra environment variables for the spawned process |
| `initialization_options` | no | Passed to the server's LSP `initialize` request |
| `disabled` | no | Skip this server even though it's registered |

**Missing-tool warnings:** on startup, AFT detects configured-but-missing formatters, type
checkers, and LSP binaries (for languages your project actually uses) and surfaces a one-time
notification per warning through whatever notification channel the harness exposes (OpenCode's
ignored-message channel, Pi's status messages). Dismissed warnings do not re-fire on plugin
updates — dedupe is per-warning-content, persisted in `<storage_dir>/warned_tools.json`.

## LSP auto-install

AFT auto-installs language servers your project actually needs. npm-distributed servers are
installed with `npm install --no-save --ignore-scripts` into AFT's cache (works under Node-only
hosts, no Bun required); standalone binaries (clangd, lua-ls, zls, tinymist, texlab) download from
GitHub releases. The cache lives at `~/.cache/aft/lsp-packages/` and `~/.cache/aft/lsp-binaries/`
(Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/aft/...`).

Configure via `lsp.*`:

```jsonc
"lsp": {
  // Auto-install relevant language servers on plugin startup. Default: true.
  // Set false to require manual install (servers still work if on PATH).
  "auto_install": true,

  // Supply-chain grace window in days. AFT only installs versions that have
  // been on the registry / GitHub releases for at least this many days,
  // defending against newly-published malicious versions that get yanked
  // within hours of detection. Default: 7. User pins via `lsp.versions`
  // bypass this.
  "grace_days": 7,

  // Per-package version pin map. Pins bypass the grace filter.
  // Keys: npm package name OR `owner/repo` for GitHub-hosted servers.
  "versions": {
    "typescript-language-server": "5.0.0",
    "clangd/clangd": "21.1.0"
  }
}
```

**Trust boundary:** `lsp.auto_install`, `lsp.grace_days`, `lsp.versions`, `lsp.servers`, and
`lsp.disabled` are **user-only** — values from project config (`<project>/.cortexkit/aft.jsonc`)
are stripped on load. A hostile repository cannot weaken your supply-chain
defenses, redirect AFT to download a different binary, or silently disable LSPs you rely on.
The plugin logs a warning when it strips a project-level setting.

**Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) verification:** AFT records the SHA-256 of every downloaded
GitHub release archive in `.aft-installed`. If the same tag is ever re-installed with a
different hash, AFT refuses the install and points to `aft doctor --clear` for manual
recovery. The hash is also logged to the plugin log on every install for forensic comparison
against published checksums.

**What we do not do (yet):** AFT does **not** ship a vetted checksum allowlist. The TOFU
defense above only protects against post-cache-warmup tampering; the very first install of
any tag is accepted as-is once it passes the grace window and TLS verification. Supply-chain
attacks faster than the grace window are a residual risk. A fully-vetted allowlist is on the
roadmap.

## Durable logs and performance ticks

AFT keeps its own logs under `<storage_root>/logs/`. The storage root follows the
same resolution as indexes and other persistent data: configured `storage_dir`,
then `$AFT_CACHE_DIR/aft`, then the platform CortexKit data directory (normally
`~/.local/share/cortexkit/aft` on Linux and macOS).

- Rust module processes write `aft-<pid>.log`. Each process file rolls at 20 MB
  through `.1` to `.5`; files from dead PIDs are removed after seven days.
- OpenCode and Pi plugin messages share `aft-plugin.log`, which uses the same
  20 MB / five-generation rotation policy. The `[aft-plugin]` and `[aft-pi]`
  tags identify the source.
- Module lines continue to go to stderr as well, so daemon capture remains
  available while the durable files provide a module-owned history.

When AFT is active, the module emits a `perf tick:` line at most once per minute.
It summarizes watcher and drain activity, Tier-2 and semantic work, callgraph
invalidations, executor completions, and oldest queued-job ages since the prior
tick. Idle intervals stay silent. `RUST_LOG` keeps its existing env_logger
semantics and defaults to `info`.

## Working with large repositories

If you point AFT at a very large directory (monorepo root, `~/Work`, `/home`, etc.), certain
features guard against unbounded work to keep the bridge responsive:

- **Call-graph ops** (`callers`, `trace_to`, `trace_data`, `impact`) use the persisted store and
  are not capped by the removed legacy in-memory reverse-index limit.
- **Semantic indexing** is capped at `semantic.max_files` source files (default 20,000). Raise it
  when using a remote backend that embeds server-side, or lower it on memory-constrained machines.
- **`grep`, `glob`, `read`, `edit`, and other tools** work at any size.

Commands with heavier workloads get longer per-call timeouts: 60s for `callers`, `trace_to`,
`trace_data`, `impact`, `grep`, `glob`; 45s for `semantic_search`; 30s for everything else.
For best results in very large trees, point AFT at a specific project subdirectory.


## Ignoring files (`.gitignore` / `.aftignore`)

Every AFT walk — trigram index, semantic index, call graph, and `aft_inspect` —
honors `.gitignore` (including `.git/info/exclude` and nested `.gitignore`
files) and skips common build directories (`node_modules`, `target`, `dist`,
`build`, `.venv`, and similar).

AFT also honors an optional **`.aftignore`** file: the same syntax as
`.gitignore`, hierarchical, and working in non-git projects, layered on top of
`.gitignore`. Use it to exclude paths AFT shouldn't index that you can't put in
`.gitignore` — most commonly git submodules. Edits under an `.aftignore`d path
also stop triggering reindexing.

Naming a file explicitly in `grep` (e.g. `path: "captures/log.txt"`) searches it
even when it is gitignored or `.aftignore`d, matching ripgrep — an explicitly
named file is always searched.
